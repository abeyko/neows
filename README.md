This was a coding challenge I completed, where the task was to make an api that accepted a post request which listed specific criteria to be searched for and return a list of asteroids (from NASAâ€™s near earth object web service API) that were approaching Earth that matched the given date and proximity range criteria, as defined in the post request.

## Setup
```npm install```

## Run
```npm start```

## Submit POST Request
